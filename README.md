# GRADE-ASSIGNER-
I created a Grade Assigner that assigns a letter grade to a student based on their score. It uses an if-elif-else structure. Grade A is 90-100, Grade B is 80-89, Grade C is 70-79, Grade D is 60-69, and Grade F is below 60. Encode the code, then test the function with various inputs to ensure it assigns the correct grades.
